# üß≠ WorkMatch Visual Documentation

This repository includes [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams that visualise both the **architecture** and **workflow** of the WorkMatch AI career guidance system.

These diagrams are designed to support developer onboarding, prompt understanding, and system explainability for hackathons, demos, and ongoing iteration.

## üìê Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram outlines the high-level components of the WorkMatch system.

### How to Generate

1. Install Mermaid CLI (if not already installed)

   npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

2. Generate the SVG diagram

   mmdc -i workmatch_architecture.mmd -o workmatch_architecture.svg

3. (Optional) Generate a PNG instead

   mmdc -i workmatch_architecture.mmd -o workmatch_architecture.png

   You can also customise the theme and resolution, for example:

   mmdc -i workmatch_architecture.mmd -o workmatch_architecture.svg -t forest -w 1400

### File Info

- For local editing: VS Code with **Markdown Preview Mermaid Support** extension is recommended
- Re-generate the diagrams whenever `.mmd` content is updated

## üìù Contribution Notes

If you update prompts, agent logic, or add new tools, please:

- Update the `.mmd` files accordingly
- Re-run the diagram generation steps
- Commit the updated `.svg` or `.png` outputs

This ensures WorkMatch remains easy to understand for contributors and collaborators.
